# [guard.sh](https://github.com/Hohlas/solana-guard/blob/main/guard.sh)

A script for seamless voting failover between primary and secondary Solana nodes.

![Guard Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc4895a3-e356-43f4-b807-dd3a020a8925)

## Key Features

- **Automatic Failover**: Switches voting to the secondary server when the primary server node enters Delinquent status.
- **Forced Failover**: Initiates voting on the secondary server with the \`guard p\` argument, provided there is sufficient time before the next block and the secondary server's health and Behind status are satisfactory.
- **Continuous Operation**: Automatically adjusts server roles (Primary/Secondary) based on node voting status without requiring a script restart.
- **Mutual Monitoring**: The primary server monitors the \`guard.sh\` script on the secondary server, and vice versa, preventing accidental monitoring interruptions.
- **Node Health Monitoring**: Tracks critical metrics for both servers, including:
  - Next slot minutes.
  - Health status (\`health\`).
  - Behind status for both local and remote servers.

  ![Node Status](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86e854f3-dd91-467f-983d-66c5a9fc346a)

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Records all events, including Behind incidents and node switches, in a log file.

  ![Log Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7b1e38e-a728-4728-8256-bb9cc657feb3)

- **Telegram Alerts**: Sends notifications for node switches and Behind events on both servers via Telegram.

- **Priority Server Assignment**: Designates a priority server for voting with the \`guard p\` argument, automatically reverting voting to the priority server once its health and Behind status normalize.

  ![Permanent Primary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c088160d-1385-48fd-8512-b59d225cee68)

- **Proactive Failover**: Triggers voting failover if the primary server is Behind for \`X*5\` seconds (configured with \`guard X\`), without waiting for Delinquent status.

  ![Guard with Threshold](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be7acc25-26f4-40a0-84c8-4be7855ece3b)

- **Connection Loss Handling**: Restarts the Solana service in "No Voting" mode on the primary server if internet connectivity is lost for over 15 seconds.
- **Service Management**: Synchronizes \`telegraf\` and \`relayer\` services with the Primary/Secondary status of each server.

## Secondary Server Workflow

- **Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the health and Behind status of both the secondary and voting nodes.
- **Role Detection**: Compares the voting node's IP address with the local IP. If they match, the server transitions to Primary status.
- **Failover Triggers**: Initiates voting failover to the secondary server when the secondary node has no Behind and one of the following occurs:
  - The voting node is in Delinquent status.
  - The voting node's Behind exceeds the threshold (\`X*5\` seconds) when started with \`guard X\`.
  - The \`permanent_primary\` flag is set with \`guard p\`.
- **Failover Process**:
  - Disables voting on the primary server by switching to a non-voting key.
  - Copies the tower file from the primary server (updated every 5 seconds to handle potential internet outages).
  - Enables voting on the secondary server.
  - Disables \`telegraf\` and \`relayer\` services on the primary server and enables them on the secondary.
  - Waits for the network to update the node's IP address, transitioning from Secondary to Primary status.
- **Error Handling**:
  - If switching the key on the primary server fails, restarts the Solana service in "No Voting" mode.
  - If the restart fails, attempts to reboot the primary server via SSH.
  - If reboot fails, checks ping to the primary server.
  - If the primary server is unreachable, assumes it has restarted in "No Voting" mode due to connectivity loss.
  - If the primary server is reachable, continues attempts to disable voting.
  - Before enabling voting, verifies the primary server's voting status using \`solana-validator --ledger '\$LEDGER' contact-info\` to prevent duplicate voting.

## Primary Server Workflow

- **Connection Monitoring**: Restarts the Solana service in "No Voting" mode if internet connectivity is lost for over 15 seconds.
- **Role Detection**: Compares the voting node's IP with the local IP. If they differ, transitions to Secondary status.
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks health and Behind status for both the voting and secondary nodes.

## Installation

### Download \`guard.sh\`
Fetch the latest version and set up an alias:
```bash
# download guard.sh
LATEST_TAG_URL=https://api.github.com/repos/Hohlas/solana-guard/releases/latest
TAG=$(curl -sSL "$LATEST_TAG_URL" | jq -r '.tag_name')

if [ -d ~/solana-guard ]; then 
	echo "update latest release $TAG"
	curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hohlas/solana-guard/$TAG/guard.sh > $HOME/solana-guard/guard.sh
	curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hohlas/solana-guard/$TAG/check.sh > $HOME/solana-guard/check.sh
else 
	echo "clone latest release $TAG"
	git clone https://github.com/Hohlas/solana-guard.git ~/solana-guard
	cd ~/solana-guard
	git fetch --tags 
	git checkout tags/$TAG
	git submodule update --init --recursive
fi

chmod +x ~/solana-guard/guard.sh
chmod +x ~/solana-guard/check.sh

# set aliases
BASHRC_FILE="$HOME/.bashrc"
if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	NEW_ALIAS="alias guard='source ~/solana-guard/guard.sh'"
	if ! grep -qxF "$NEW_ALIAS" "$BASHRC_FILE"; then
		echo "$NEW_ALIAS" >> "$BASHRC_FILE"
		echo "add new alias: [$NEW_ALIAS]"
	fi
	NEW_ALIAS="alias check='source ~/solana-guard/check.sh'"
	if ! grep -qxF "$NEW_ALIAS" "$BASHRC_FILE"; then
		echo "$NEW_ALIAS" >> "$BASHRC_FILE"
		echo "add new alias: [$NEW_ALIAS]"
	fi
else
    echo "file $HOME/.bashrc not found."
fi

source $HOME/.bashrc
```

### Configure Solana Service
The Solana service must start with a non-voting key (\`empty-validator.json\`).

Generate a non-voting key:
```bash
if [ ! -f ~/solana/empty-validator.json ]; then 
    solana-keygen new -s --no-bip39-passphrase -o ~/solana/empty-validator.json
fi
```

Update \`solana.service\` configuration:
```bash
--identity /root/solana/empty-validator.json \
--authorized-voter /root/solana/validator-keypair.json \
--vote-account /root/solana/vote.json \
```

### Set Up Keys Directory
Create a RAM disk for the keys directory:
```bash
if [ ! -d "/mnt/keys" ]; then
    mkdir -p /mnt/keys
    chmod 600 /mnt/keys 
	echo "# KEYS to RAMDISK 
	tmpfs /mnt/keys tmpfs nodev,nosuid,noexec,nodiratime,size=1M 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
	mount /mnt/keys
	echo "create and mount /mnt/keys in RAMDISK"
else
    echo "/mnt/keys exist"
fi
```

Create symbolic links to the keys directory:
```bash
# create links
ln -sf /mnt/keys ~/keys
ln -sf /mnt/keys/vote-keypair.json ~/solana/vote.json
ln -sf /mnt/keys/validator-keypair.json ~/solana/validator-keypair.json
```

### Configure \`guard.cfg\`
Settings are stored in \`~/guard.cfg\`. For Telegram notifications, a \`BOT_TOKEN\` is required.

To improve reliability, the script queries an alternative RPC ([Helius RPC](https://dashboard.helius.dev)) alongside Solana's RPC. If responses match, the result is accepted. If they differ, 10 additional queries are made to each RPC, accepting the answer if 75% of responses agree. A free Helius account lasts about three days, so the script cycles through the \`RPC_LIST\` when one server stops responding.

Example \`guard.cfg\':
```bash
PORT='22' # remote server ssh port
KEYS=$HOME/keys
SOLANA_SERVICE=$HOME/solana/solana.service
BEHIND_WARNING=false # 'false'- send telegramm INFO missage, when behind. 'true'-send ALERT message
WARNING_FREQUENCY=12 # max frequency of warning messages (WARNING_FREQUENCY x 5) seconds
BEHIND_OK_VAL=3 # behind, that seemed ordinary
RELAYER_SERVICE=false # use restarting jito-relayer service
CHAT_ALARM=-100..684
CHAT_INFO=-100..888
BOT_TOKEN=507625...VICllWU
RPC_LIST=(
"https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/..."
"https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/..."
"https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/..."
)
```

### SSH Key Setup
Place private SSH keys (\`any_name.ssh\`) for both servers in \`~/keys\`.

### Launch Order
Run \`guard.sh\` on the secondary server first to copy its IP to the primary server. Subsequent launches can be in any order.

## Companion Script: \`check.sh\`
A utility for convenient server status monitoring.

## Notes
- Ensure \`bc\` is installed (\`apt install bc\`) for numerical calculations.
- The secondary server must be fully operational and reachable via SSH before running \`guard.sh\` on the primary server.
- Regularly update \`guard.sh\` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.
